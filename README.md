# Test assignment description

For this test assignment, I have chosen React.js (based on create-react-app), typescript (out of the box of create-react-app), redux and CSS modules.
To save user states between page reloading, I have used redux-persist; it allows me to keep all necessary information once and do not fetch data from the server we already have on the client-side.

This application works without bugs on macOS (Chrome latest) & iOS (Safari latest).

For transition effect - instead of a drawer, I have chosen an opacity based transition. In my opinion, it has better UX, and for users, it feels more smooth.

Also, some custom styles were added to google maps.

I hope you like this test assignment code, looking for feedback!
